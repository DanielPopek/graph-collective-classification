# Collective classification in labels

The object of the project is to propose a collective classification algorithm dealing with label classification
nodes in the shared dataset.
The data set is e-mail communication in a production company and data on who reports to whom (organizational structure).
The proposed collective classification algorithm should decide which nodes to discover and how to propagate knowledge about
their labels to make the classification as accurate as possible. 

ICM (Iterative Classification Algorithm) was used as base approach. 

## Subtaks 
1. Implementation and evaluation of the selected collective classification algorithm for the node label classification task 
2. Conducting research on the selection of initial nodes for label discovery (selection method and percentage of labels uncovered) 
3. Comparison of the implemented algorithm with another

Due to imbalanced classes distribution F-SCORE meassure was used to evaluate algorithms.
